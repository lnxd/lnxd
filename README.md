### Hi there  ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alex and I'm located in Melbourne, Australia.

I'm an (in)active part of the **Unraid Community**, and you'll notice a lot of my contributions are oriented towards that.

I have a passing familiarity with lots of languages, including `Python`, `Swift`, `CSS`, `HTML5`, `PHP`, `Ruby` and I've written far more shell scripts than I'd care to admit. I'm a `Linux` and `Mac` user that mostly lives in Terminal, but I've occasionally played around with `Windows`.

I'm a big fan of **Docker**, and most of my work is optionally containerised.

I've tinkered quite a bit with 3D printers, and you'll notice some of my repositories pertain to that.

If you see a repo here that has an open license, feel free to fork it and edit it to your heart's content. If you see a mistake somewhere or need some help, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
