### Hi there  ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alex, and I'm located in Melbourne, Australia.

I'm an (in)active part of the **Unraid Community**, and you'll notice a lot of my contributions are oriented towards that.

I have a passing familiarity with lots of languages, including `Python`, `Javascript`, `CSS`, `HTML5`, `PHP`, and `Ruby`, and I've written far more `Bash` scripts than I'd care to admit. I'm a `Linux` and `Mac` user that mostly lives in Terminal, but I've occasionally played around with `Windows`.

I'm a big fan of `Docker`, and most of my work is optionally containerised.

I've tinkered with 3D printers, and you'll notice some of my repositories pertain to that.

I'm always looking for ways to push the boundaries of what's possible, and I'm constantly striving to positively impact the world through code.

If you see a repo here with an open license, feel free to fork it and edit it to your heart's content. If you see a mistake somewhere or need some help, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
