I'm Alex, a software developer in Melbourne, Australia.
Previously at Apple.

Python, Bash, Docker, and whatever else gets it done.
Proxmox and k3s run everything.

Most of my time goes into an ML-driven trading system.
The public repos here are a mix of infrastructure, embedded, and tools built along the way.

**Some recent projects:**
- MCP servers (joplin-mcp-server)
- ESP32 firmware (gate controllers, garage sensors)
- Keyboard LED controllers (c-k68-controller)
- Async trading clients (python-ctrader)

**Interests:** Home automation, infrastructure, embedded systems, algorithmic trading.

Issues and PRs welcome.
